# zxcvbn-gui
A GUI for [zxcvbn-cs](https://github.com/bitbeans/zxcvbn-cs), which is based on [zxcvbn](https://github.com/dropbox/zxcvbn).

## From the `Zxcvbn` readme:

> `zxcvbn`, named after a crappy password, is a JavaScript password strength
> estimation library. Use it to implement a custom strength bar on a
> signup form near you!
>
> `zxcvbn` attempts to give sound password advice through pattern matching
> and conservative entropy calculations. It finds 10k common passwords,
> common American names and surnames, common English words, and common
> patterns like dates, repeats (aaa), sequences (abcd), and QWERTY
> patterns.
